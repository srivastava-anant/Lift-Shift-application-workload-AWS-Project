# üåê Multi-Tier Application: Scalable Deployment on AWS

## üëã Hello and Welcome!

This project showcases the successful migration and deployment of a complex **Multi-Tier Java Web Application** onto a robust, scalable infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It represents a critical shift from a local virtualized environment to a production-ready cloud architecture, demonstrating core DevOps and Cloud Engineering principles.

### üèÜ Project Highlights & Key Achievements

100% AWS Deployment: Completed a full "Lift and Shift" migration to AWS, leveraging its native managed services for enhanced stability and scale.
Security Architecture: Implemented a multi-layered security model using granular **Security Groups** to ensure only necessary traffic flows between the Web, Application, and Data tiers.
Scalability & HA: Engineered the application tier with an **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** behind an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, guaranteeing the application can handle traffic spikes and remain highly available.
Structured Deployment: Followed a precise, repeatable deployment roadmap, ensuring every component, from DNS to Caching, was configured correctly.

## üó∫Ô∏è AWS Deployment Roadmap: My Process

The deployment was executed in structured phases, ensuring stability and correctness:

### Phase 1: Foundation & Security

1. Security Setup: Established **EC2 Key Pairs** and defined granular **Security Groups** for the Web, App, and Backend tiers.
2. Core Compute: Launched all dedicated **EC2 Instances** for the application and messaging services into private subnets.
3. Internal Networking: Configured a **Route 53 Private Hosted Zone** to enable secure and simple hostname resolution between internal services.

### Phase 2: Application, Scaling & Traffic

4. Build & Artifact Deployment: Compiled the code using **Maven** and uploaded the production-ready WAR file to a private **S3** bucket for reliable distribution to the EC2 instances.
5. Elasticity: Configured the **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**, defining launch templates and scaling policies to dynamically adjust the number of application servers based on load.
6. Public Access: Created the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to manage external traffic. A public **Route 53** record was then pointed to the ALB to finalize external DNS routing.
7. Validation: Performed comprehensive checks to confirm all services were communicating correctly, the ASG was scaling, and the application was fully accessible.
